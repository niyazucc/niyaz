                    It was 6th March 2022 where i started texting this one cute girl i saw on padlet. The moment i saw her face, i instantly melted because of her beauty and cuteness.
                    I started texting her through whatsapp, and we all started knowing each other. I found out that she has lot of similar things to me. I was so happy that i met her.
                    As the time move on, i devided to confess my feelings to her and luckily she accept it. Now i am having the best life ever. I met someone who understand me, who love me,
                    who is cute, who loves to eat chocolate soooo muchh and kind.
